  description: null
  life_stage: Seed
  life_history_process: Germination
  type: categorical
  allowed_values_levels:
    PY: Physical dormancy (PY) is caused by a water-impermeable seed coat. Typically
      overcome by scarification, fire-related heat pulse and/or high temperatures
    PD: Physiological dormancy (PD) is caused by a chemical or physiological block
      within the seed, driven by the balance between the growth inhibiting and growth
      promoting hormones ABA and GA. It is overcome by cold or warm stratification
      or dry after-ripening, environmental conditions which are experienced after
      seed dispersal over the seasons. Often related to having seasonal germination
      cues
    PY-PD: A combination of physical dormancy (PY) and physiological dormancy (PD)
      (see definitions above). Both forms of dormancy must be overcome for germination
      to result.
    MPD: A combination of morphological dormancy (MD), caused by an underdeveloped
      embryo, and physiological dormancy (PD) (see definition above). Both forms of
      dormancy must be overcome for germination to result, with both dormancy types
      potentially broken down under the same environmental conditions.
    MD: Morphological dormancy (MD) is caused by an underdeveloped embryo in seeds
      that do not have physiological dormancy (PD). Embryos need to grow to the full
      length of the seed before germination can occur, so this embryo growth period
      delays germination.
    ND: Non-dormant (ND) species are able to germinate upon release, across a wide
      range of environmental conditions.

      morphological structures or traits. Inference based on structure of protective
      and regenerative organs with reference to resprouting responses of species with
      similar organs
    Inferred from related taxa: Assigned to same category as congeners or confamilials
      that have similar visible features, pending direct evidence. Based on congeneric
      species with similar protective/recovery organs and habitats
    Manipulative experiment: Manipulative experiment. Individuals sampled before and
      after fire treatment causing <100% scorch
    Qualitative estimate: Guestimate from visual assessment of post-fire wild population.
      Guestimate from visual assessment of post-fire wild population
    Unspecified methods: Methods unclear or undocumented.

  allowed_values_levels:
    Epicormic: Resprouting from epicormic meristematic tissues or buds beneath bark
      on woody aerial stems
    Apical: Resprouting from active shoots protected by crowded leaf bases on woody
      stems
    Lignotuber: Resprouting from meristematic tissues or buds on lignotubers (swollen
      woody organ) at or just below the soil surface
    Basal: Resprouting from meristematic tissues or buds at the base of woody stems
      at or just below the soil surface
    Tuber: Resprouting from non-woody nodular subsoil organs (bulbs, corms, tubers,
      taproots) with active shoots or dormant buds
    Tussock: Shoots protected and resprouting within tightly clustered tillers and
      resprouting  without significant lateral spread
    Long rhizome or root sucker: Resprouting from buried woody or non-woody horizontal
      organs capable of lateral spread, typically >0.5m. Includes root suckers.
    Short rhizome: Resprouting from buried woody or non-woody horizontal organs, but
      not capable of significant lateral spread, typically <0.5m.
    Stolon: Resprouting from non-woody horizontal organs on or just below the soil
      surface
    None: No vegetative recovery - killed by fire
