## Components of the project

### Import data into the database

:dart: [This repository](https://github.com/ces-unsw-edu-au/fireveg-db-imports) contains several [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try) with code and instruction to perform several tasks in the database.

Visualisation of the notebooks is possible in GitHub, or in the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/).

Instructions to use this repository are in the [Instructions and workflow Notebook](Instructions-and-workflow.ipynb). 

This repository is part of the OSF project component:
