## Components of the project

### SQL structure of the database

Code for defining the structure of the tables in a PostgreSQL database is available in the [fireveg-db](https://github.com/ces-unsw-edu-au/fireveg-db) repository.


### Database content

An export of the SQL structure and iniitial data is available in Figshare:

### WebApp

Code for running a Flask webapp available in the [fireveg-webapp](https://github.com/ces-unsw-edu-au/fireveg-webapp) repository.

### Code for managing the database

This repository contains several [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/try) with code and instruction to perform several tasks in the database.

Visualisation of the notebooks is possible in GitHub, or in the [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.org/).

#### Repository structure

- Folder [workflow/](/workflow/) include jupyter notebooks organised in sub-folders describing data import/export steps for different sources of data.
   - [Field-forms/](/workflow/Field-forms): code for reading field-work data from excel documents
   - [Import-austraits/](/workflow/mport-austraits)
   - [Import-NSWFRD/](/workflow/Import-NSWFRD)
   - [Input-forms/](/workflow/Input-forms)
   - [Literature-review/](/workflow/Literature-review)
   - [Report-output/](/workflow/Report-output): code for writing output `xlsx` documents with summaries of fire ecology traits for plants
   - Folder [R/](/workflow/R). Some scripts in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) are also available.
