The site was last burnt in 1990. The geology of the site is Hawkesbury sandstone, weathering to low nutrient soils (total soil phosphorus 94 mg/kg, Wright, Reich & Westoby 2001). Gap fractions (see below) were mostly in the range 0.3–0.7; the shrub species were growing in dappled light rather than in dense shade with occasional sunflecks."

TTNP is situated within the Patho Plains, a sub-section of the Victorian Northern Plains Bioregion, and includes the Terrick Terrick Range and adjacent plain. Average annual precipitation for the Patho plains is ~400 mm, with winter months weakly dominating the rainfall patterns. Seasonal average maximum temperatures range from 30 deg C in summer to 15 deg C in winter. Seasonal average minimums range from 15 deg C in summer to 3 deg C in winter. The vegetation is a semi-arid Callitris grassy woodland typical of the rocky outcrops and outwash slopes at TTNP."

Catford_2014,Yarrawonga,description,"The surrounding floodplain has been used for logging, livestock grazing, as a source of charcoal and honey, and for settlement, recreation and tourism (Eastburn 1990). Current forestry practice is based on selective logging or clearing of small patches. Cattle grazing commenced in 1838 and continues today, but sheep grazing has largely ceased (Smith and Smith 1990). There was no tree canopy directly above the study wetlands. All soil in the region was similar (~45% clay content)."

Falster_2005_2,Myall_Lakes,description,"The study was conducted in low-open sclerophyll forest situated in Myall Lakes National Park in southeastern Australia. Annual precipitation is moderate (1352 mm, 105 year average, Sugarloaf point), with some rain in all months. Mean annual temperature is 17 deg C. The park contains a diversity of vegetation structural types delimited by substrate variation arising from past and present dune formation (Myerscough et al. 1995). We restricted our study to a large section of the park (~8000 ha) situated on a relatively homogenous substrate of freely draining Holocene sands (Myerscough and Carolin 1986. Vegetation in the study area is characterised by an open tree-layer to 35 m consisting of Eucalyptus pilularis, E. gummifera and Angophora costata. These species are rarely killed by fire and readily resprout from epicormic buds (Fox and Fox 1986). A diverse understorey is dominated by shrubs from the families Fabaceae, Mimosaceae, Epacridaceae and Proteaceae. Most aboveground biomass among understorey species is killed by fire, with regrowth from either seed or below ground reserves. Approximately half of all species retain some capacity to resprout after fire (Fox 1988)."

Henery_2001,Kuringgai_NP,description,"Sites were widely separated level surfaces with similar (9-11 yr) elapsed time since the last fire and with a common soil type derived from a geology of underlying Hawkesbury sandstone. These soils are depauperate in nutrients, notably phosphorus (Beadle 1962). The vegetation was a fire prone mixture of low heath and dry sclerophyll woodland with a species-rich (Rice and Westoby 1983) understorey of woody shrubs primarily from the families Proteaceae, Fabaceae and Myrtaceae. Only three species (genus Persoonia) had fleshy fruits, the remainder comprising relatively dry dehiscent woody follicles, legumes, capsules and schizocarps.Sites were chosen with a high proportion of species in common, since the aim was to replicate each species across two or three sites, as well as to replicate individuals within each site."

Lawes_2012,East Point Reserve,description,"East Point Reserve is a regionally significant remnant of coastal monsoon forest (Panton 1993). The forest belongs to Group 9 of Russell-Smith (1991) and is described as semideciduous rainforest and vine thicket. Monsoon forest on the East Point peninsula was extensively cleared and burnt from 1932 to 1963 (Franklin, Matthews & Lawes 2010), and we sampled only forest remnants that had not been previously cleared or burnt."

Lawes_2012,Litchfield,description,"The vegetation in LNP is dominated by eucalypt open forests and woodlands, with a grassy understorey, referred to hereafter as tropical savanna. The seasonal climate is particularly conducive to high fire frequencies, the wet season is highly productive with abundant grass growth, while the 7-month dry season (c. May-November) strongly promotes grass curing and flammability. Fires are typically ground fires and are fuelled by native Sorghum spp. grasses. On average 66% of LNP is burnt per annum (Russell-Smith et al. 2009). Data from tropical savannas were collected from vegetation monitoring plots (20 m x 40 m) that were established between March 1994 and August 1996 in LNP. These monitoring plot data indicate that 86% of fires in LNP are of low (2 m scorch height) or moderate (sub-canopy scorch) severity. We sampled only those plots that had been burnt at least in the previous dry season or more recently and had been burnt in at least five of the previous 12 years, that is an average fire return interval of c. 1.5 years (Northern Territory Bushfires Council, unpublished data). Fire severity in the plots we surveyed was of low to moderate intensity."

Leishman_1993,Sydney_area,description,"We selected eight sites in national parks or state forests around the northern and southern suburbs of Sydney, Australia, -34 deg S, 151 deg  E. Substantial areas of natural vegetation on infertile sandstone are conserved around Sydney, but most fertile soils were cleared quite early during European colonization. Only small patches of fertile-soil vegetation remain, usually within large areas of infertile Hawkesbury Sandstone. We were able to distribute our four fertile sites over three substrate types. Sites on infertile soil were then chosen to be interspersed with the fertile sites (Fig. 1), and to include both woodland and heathland vegetation, even though Rice and Westoby (1981) had found no evidence vegetation structure affected the incidence of dispersal by ants among infertile-soil vegetation types. Northernmost sites locations in Kuring'gai National Park and southernmost sites in Royal National Park. See Westoby et al. 1990 for map of site locations."

This region has a dry monsoonal climate- most of the annual rainfall (which can vary from 840mm to 2800 mm) falls from December to March; however June to September is characterized by intense drought. The dataset was compiled by J.E. and supplemented with species lists from Taylor & Dunlop (1985).

Pekin_2011,Collis,description,"Near the town of Walpole, WA. We chose a single landform unit (Collis, sensu Churchward et al. (1988)) at the southern extent of southwest Australia as our study area (Fig. 1) in order to ensure a consistent species pool across our study sites. The Collis landform displays yellow duplex soils on upland, nonwaterlogged terrain, and is dominated by jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) and marri (Corymbia calophylla Lindl.) trees in the overstorey and a dense shrub layer in the understorey (see Pekin et al. in press for details on floristics). Sixteen study sites with variable fire histories were selected for conducting floral surveys within this area (Fig. 1). The recent fire history (1972-2004) of each site was obtained from a database of digitized fire boundaries produced by the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) (Hamilton et al. 2009). While the study sites had a mixed history of prescribed and wild fires, all sites were burnt by either a prescribed burn in late 2002 or a large wildfire, which burned through much of the study area in early 2003, and were not burned again prior to the time of floral surveys; hence, the last fire had occurred in the same fire season and the time since last fire was the same for all sites at the time of sampling (see Pekin et al. in press for details on fire history across the sites). In southwest Australia, the conservative interval between lethal fires has been suggested at twice the juvenile period of the slowest maturing obligate seeder (Burrows & Wardell-Johnson 2003), which corresponds to ~6 years in this ecosystem (Burrows et al. 2008). Consequently, sites for this study were selected to represent either two consecutive short fire intervals of up to 5 years (SS); two consecutive long fire intervals of 11 years or longer (LL); or mixed fire interval lengths (M) (Hamilton et al. 2009). The climate of southwest Australia is mediterranean, where most of the precipitation falls during winter and there is an extended drought over summer. Hence, even small changes in mean annual precipitation in this environment can strongly affect water stress for plants, and the regional distribution of plant species and vegetation types is primarily a function of water availability (Beard, 1983). Annual rainfall near the coast is ~1200mm but decreases sharply towards the northeast (Bureau of Meteorology 2008) with distance inland, even though the landscape is relatively flat. We obtained interpolated climatic data for the location of each of our sites for the past ~35 years (1970 to 2008) from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (2008). Local mean annual precipitation (P) was adjusted for elevation using BIOCLIM (Nix 1986), and mean annual potential evapotranspiration (PET) was calculated from an existing database of gridded climate variables (Jeffrey et al. 2001). Site aridity was quantified with an aridity index (AI = PET/P) and used as an indicator of moisture availability (Pekin et al. 2009). Our study area displays a relatively sharp gradient of increasing rainfall from ~850 mm annually in the northeast to ~1100mmin the southwest across a distance of ~25km (Fig. 1). Thus, the aridity index across our sites is likely to reflect a significant variation in the availability of moisture for plants over the summer drought season."

Taseski_2017,Royal National Park,description,"The study was conducted in an area of wet heathland vegetation within the Royal National Park, New South Wales, Australia (34 deg 5'43.22""S, 151 deg 9'9.97""E) in May 2016 to January 2017. The site is within the study area of Letten et al.(2015) on a local soil moisture gradient, which marks a transition between two vegetation classes known as Sydney Coastal Heaths on drier soils and Coastal Heath Swamps on wetter soils (Keith 2004). Both communities are comprised of sclerophyllous woody shrub layer and an herbaceous ground layer (denser in heath swamp), with species in the Proteaceae, Ericaceae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae, Restionaceae, Poaceae and Cyperaceae dominant throughout (Keith, 2004). The soils are sandy loams derived from sandstone, acidic and low in nutrient concentrations (Keith and Myerscough 1993). Parts of the site were subjected to low intensity burns in 2015 and in 1994. We sampled patches with different fire histories in order to control for some of the variation that may be induced by these events."

Vesk_2004,Round Hill Camp,description,"Round Hill Nature reserve, NSW. The climate is warm and semi-arid. The closest meteorological station, Mt. Hope 30 km north-west, has median annual rainfall of 370 mm (220- 595, 1st to 9th deciles), and mean maximum daily temperatures ranging from 14.28C in July to 32.58C in February (Fig. 1). Monthly rainfall is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year, but is associated with patchy thunderstorms in summer and persistent but less intense fronts in winter. The area comprises low hills and foot-slopes, plains and dune fields, with dominant vegetation types open Callitris glaucophylla -Eucalyptus populnea woodland and Eucalyptus dumosa -E. socialis shrub mallee woodland (Cohn 1995). Wildfire in open woodland recurs every 5_/20 years when years of above average rainfall allow sufficient grass (Stipa spp. ) fuel to build up (Walker et al. 1981, reviewed by Hobbs 2002). In these fires, mature trees may escape total leaf scorch, while shrubs and ground storey commonly experience total leaf scorch. Mallee woodland experiences fire with a similar mean frequency, though with less variable inter-fire periods as Triodia scariosa (porcupine grass) fuel breaks down more slowly than Stipa spp. in open woodland and so is retained over a number of years (Bradstock 1989, Noble 1989, Bradstock and Cohn 2002). In mallee fires, all growth forms commonly experience total leaf scorch, allowing for patchiness in intensity, in turn dependent upon the balance More info on Round Hill Sites in Cohn, J. S. (1995).

Wright_2019,Howard_Springs,description,"We sampled species at Howard Springs Nature Reserve, 30 km east from Darwin. The savanna vegetation there is typical of the region, with an overstory dominated by eucalypts and an understory dominated by C4 grasses. Overstory leaf area index ranges between about 0.6 in the dry season to 1 in the wet season (Hutley et al. 2001). At Darwin airport (20 km to the west), long-term annual rainfall is 1736 mm, typically with >95% of rain falling during the wet season (October-April). Mean annual temperature is 27.6 deg C (data from www.bom.gov.au). Fires occur regularly in the dry season; typical fire return intervals in the region are 1-3 years (Russell-Smith et al. 2003). Soils at the site are sandy and low in nutrients: mean (and standard deviation) nutrient concentrations in eight soil samples (0-20 cm depth) collected in September 2010 were as follows: total C = 2.7% (1.8), total N = 0.093% (0.074), total P = 72.7 mg kg_1 (22.6)."
